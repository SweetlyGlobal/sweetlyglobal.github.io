Our founder, Alec Aris, was thinking about potential business ideas for the upcoming Market Expo Day. With a passion for food and baking, Alec had the idea of creating an international cookie business, selling different types of cookies from around the world. However, after pitching the idea to friends and potential stakeholders, the business shifted from just cookies to desserts in general. Thus, the idea of Sweetly Global was born, and by combining our skills-- Alec's sociability, Olivia's technical skills, Vanessa's managerial experience, and Chloe's marketing expertise, we have succeeded in providing terrific customer service and tasty treats to our classmates and faculty.
