            <h2>Founding Story</h2>
            Our founder, Alec Aris, was thinking about potential business

            ideas for the upcoming Market Expo Day. With a passion for

            food and baking, Alec had the idea of creating an

            international cookie business, selling different types of

            cookies from around the world. However, after pitching the

            idea to friends and potential stakeholders, the business

            shifted from just cookies to desserts in general. Thus, the idea

            of Sweetly Global was born, and by combining our skills--

            Alec's sociability, Olivia's technical skills, Vanessa's

            managerial experience, and Chloe's marketing expertise, we

            have succeeded in providing terrific customer service and
            
            tasty treats to our classmates and faculty.
